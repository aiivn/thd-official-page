                <h4>
                  Students
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Our desire for the younger generation is a self-awarenes, independent and mature. 
                  That’s why we launched Social & Emotional Learning for this age group.<br/><br/>

                  In addition, we also launched the Science Film Festival with the aim of stimulating 
                  the interest and understanding of science in children. 
                  From there, they will learn more about the world around them through what they learn.

                <h4>Teachers</h4>
                <p>
                  We offer training programs focusing on two major topics: 
                  Social & Emotional Learning (SEL) & STEM. And two major projects that 
                  THD focus on deployment are Science Fim Festival and SEAD:STEM.<br/><br/>

                  We have the opportunity to train with teachers across the country on topics 
                  such as how to develop an SEL application; Developing a cross-disciplinary project 
                  with the spirit of STEM …. We hope to bring more useful knowledge to the school, 
                  so that teachers and students can experience quality content from the world.

                <h4>Parents</h4>
                <p>
                  THD’s biggest blessing is working with many students across the country. 
                  Since then, we have been in contact with many parents of children 1-12 grades and at the university.<br/><br/>

                  The family is a large school that directly influences the development of students; 
                  Because of this importance, we focus on sharing with parents about SEL, how to listen to children, 
                  how to be friends with children, how to feel safe when talking with parents. 
                  We hope to see a lot of changes, from the very least, starting with the family.
